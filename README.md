Types of assessment:
- Visual assessment
- Programmatic assessment (used Pandas)

## Clean
Programmatic data cleaning process:
- Define: convert the assessments into defined cleaning tasks.
- Code: convert those definitions to code and run that code.
- Test: test your dataset, visually or with code, to make sure cleaning operations worked.
